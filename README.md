# Room Lux

Project statement: What is the difference in light levels between two opposite-facing (North and South) rooms?

## Description

Given a lux sensor and SD card reader, gather light-level data from any room or window. Specifically, this was used to compare two opposite-facing windows (north vs south). The lux sensor read around 1400 lux from the window with an integration time of 800 ms and gain of â…›, although these values may change depending on how sunny it is when put into practice. The lux readings also print to the serial monitor.
